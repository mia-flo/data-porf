        <p class="spacer-large">I am former geoscientist and now data analyst. I love learning
        </p>
        <!-- education -->
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p class="spacer-xlarge">I received my B.S. in the Geological Sciences from San Diego State University
          before going on to spend 3.5 years as a PhD candidate in Stanford's Geological Sciences department.</p>

        <p class="spacer-xlarge">
          As a graduate student, I spent most of my time collecting and analyzing data. The data I collected was used to
          make decisions about how I allocated resources and the directions of my projects.
        </p>

        <p class="spacer-xlarge">I also participated in committees where I collaborated with faculty, administrators,
          and
          students of multiple departments as a bridge in communication.</p>
        <!-- experience -->
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p class="spacer-xlarge">I began my coding journey with <u>HTML, CSS, and Javascript through freeCodeCamp's
            webdesign course</u>.
          I found that I enjoyed the process and challenge of solving problems and creating with code. This led me to
          further explore
          coding and
        </p>
        <p class="spacer-xlarge">As a scientist, the next language I decided to learn was <u>Python</u>. I enjoyed the
          versatility
          of Python - going on to create data analysis and machine learning projects as well as simple apps and games.
          Naturally, the
          next language I learned was <u>SQL</u>.
        </p>

        <p class="spacer-xlarge">I've recently taken an interest in app and game development so am starting to learn
          <u>C#</u>.
        </p>
        <!-- hobbies -->
        <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
        <p class="spacer-xlarge">I played soccer growing up and still joined local pickup games while in graduate
          school. Recently, I've taken an
          interest in indoor bouldering. I'm still a beginner but you can check out my little bouldering blog.
        </p>
        <p class="spacer-xlarge">Video games have been near and dear to my heart since I was a child. It was one of mine
          and my sibling's favorite
          ways to spend time together and still is to this day.
        </p>

        <p class="spacer-xlarge">I am studying Japanese</p>
