                <h2>Observing impact on a country level</h2>
                <p class="spacer-small">While the data gathered may not be entirely accurate
                    for every country, we can use heatmaps to make quick, qualitative comparisons between countries
                    to
                    observe the local impact.</p>
                <!-- contracted by country -->

                    <img src="images\covid\country_contracted.PNG" alt="" class="proj-img">
                </div>
                <p class="spacer-small">Countries with relatively high rates of cases/population include the United
                    States,
                    France,
                    Australia, Iceland, New Zealand, etc.

                </div>

                <p class="spacer-small">The United States, however, had the highest number of deaths. And despite
                    a lower rate of cases reported for these countries, Brazil, Russia, India, and Mexico are just
                    some
                    of the countries that experienced a high rate of death. </p>

                <p class="spacer-small">A higher rate of death may be linked to several other factors such as
                    a patient's overall health prior to contraction, quality of available care at the time, etc.
                </p>

                <h3>Total vaccinations</h3>
                <p class="spacer-small">Vaccines started becoming available for select groups in the US at the end
                    of
                    2020 following select clinical trials.</p>
                <!--  vaccinated by country -->

                    <img src="images\covid\vacc_country.PNG" alt="" class="proj-img">
                </div>

                <p class="spacer-small">The percent of individuals who received at least one does of a vaccinane
                    is quite high except for in countries in Africa.
                </p>



                <h2>Time series analysis by select county</h2>
                <p class="spacer-small">I chose countries with large populations, some first world, and countries
                    that I
                    have
                    a personal interest in for a more indepth look.
                </p>




                <h3>Rolling count - % contracted over time by country</h3>
                <p class="spacer-small">A rolling count of percent of the population who at some point
                    contracted COVID from May 2020-May 2023. By May 2023, it is estimated that France and South
                    Korea
                    reached nearly 60% of the population who at on point contracted COVID.
                </p>
                <p class="spacer-small">And while the US had the highest rate of COVID deaths, the percent of the
                    population
                    who contracted it was roughly half that of France and South Korea.
                </p>
                <!-- percent contracted over time -->
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images\covid\country_time.PNG" alt="" class="proj-img">
                </div>
                <p class="spacer-small">Despite the introduction of
                    vaccines, the US, France, and the UK saw a steady increase in COVID contractions. Even more
                    concerning
                    was the sharp increase observed in several countries during later 2021-early 2022.
                </p>
                <p class="spacer-small">This timing seems to coincide with holidays and lockdown restrictions easing
                    up
                    and
                    a greater
                    availability of vaccinations. One would think that higher vaccination would lead to lower rates
                    of
                    contraction, but
                    perhaps
                    more people decided to congregate after receiving the vaccine.
                </p>

                <h3>Rate of population infected over time</h3>
                <!-- pop/cases over time-->

                    <img src="images\covid\rate_country.PNG" alt="" class="proj-img">
                </div>
                <p class="spacer-small">France and South Korea in particular saw large spikes in population vs
                    # of cases in the earlier parts of 2022.
                </p>
                <p class="spacer-small">Several fluctuations were observed for France.</p>

                <h3>Rate of deaths per cases over time</h3>
                <p class="spacer-small"></p>
                <!-- death/cases over time -->
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images\covid\rate_death_country.PNG" alt="" class="proj-img">
                </div>

                <p class="spacer-small">France and the UK were the early leaders in deaths per cases.</p>
                <h2>Various conditions vs COVID death rate by country</h2>
                <p class="spacer-small">It is likely that numerous different factors influenced each country's
                    deaths per COVID cases. While difficult to determine the exact factors and their combined
                    impacts on likelyhood of death after contracting COVID, I chose several variables to visualize.
                </p>
                <!-- comparing each country's rate of death to other conditions -->
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images\covid\conditions.PNG" alt="" class="proj-img">

                <p class="spacer-small">On the y-axis the log value for each country's rate of death (cases/deaths).
                    On the x-axis' are cardiovascular death rate,
                    human development index, population density, and life expectancy.
